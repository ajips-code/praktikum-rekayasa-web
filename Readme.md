### Remove file package-lock.json
if there still have package-lock.json in your directory project. just remove it so that you can install all depedencies on your project clean and automatically

### Install Depdencies
install `all dependencies in project directory` using `NPM` (Node Package Manager).
Open Terminal or Command Prompt then enter the following command:
```
npm install
```
Make sure it's installed correctly and look at the project configuration in the `package.json` file. See what dependencies are needed in each project directory

### Keep code !!! Dont just make a copy
